				<h1 style="font-family:lobster,cursive"><center>Paris</center></h1>


		<p align="justify">I once met a <strong>designer</strong> friend in a quiet Paris flat with white walls, white surfaces, and white furniture. A lunch of <strong>aesthetically</strong> prepared sushi was served consisting off;

			<p><center><a  href="http://deathisobsolete.com/wp-content/uploads/tuna-sushi.jpg" style="text-decoration:none"> Red tuna</a></center></p>
			<p><center><a href="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/a6tBjoYxbYQ/maxresdefault.jpg"style="text-decoration:none"> Pink Salmon</a></center></p>
			<p><center><a href="https://shizuokagourmet.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/aoriika-4.jpg"style="text-decoration:none"> White squid</a></center></p>
			<p><center><a href="http://www.sushi311.com/gallery/sawara2.jpg"style="text-decoration:none"> Silvery mackerel</a></center></p>

			<p align="justify"> I reached to my chopsticks to begin, when my friend said, "The taste of this meal is affected by the room we sit in".True.With everything around me in <strong>pure white</strong> including the plate upon the sushi was served, the thin slabs of raw fish atop the fist-sized mass of white rice appeared to float in space. I could imagine the taste to be very different in an environment that was appointed with different dishes,table, overall decorum and even different people. <strong>Ambience</strong> is the proverbial "secret sauce" to any great meal or <strong>memorable interaction.</strong> Creating white space-or, translating that to a room "clean space"-enables the foreground to stand out from the background.</p>

		<h2><center>Part 2</center></h2>
		<p align="justify">However the reality is that in everyday life we are unlikely to clear everything out with the ease of hitting the delete key on the word processor. The taste of any activity we face might be mixed in with the distaste of the clutter of our desk. But coincidentally the uplifting smile of a nearby child can sometimes help us to tune out any messed at hand. Being attuned to what surrounds us in the <strong>ambient environment</strong> can sometimes help us manage whats immediately in front of us. Synthesising the ambient experience of simplicity requires attention to everything that seemingly does not matter.</p>
