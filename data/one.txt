I once met a designer friend in a quiet Paris flat with white walls, white surfaces, and white furniture. A lunch of aesthetically prepared sushi was served. Red tuna, pink salmon, white squid, silvery mackerel, and a silver of green leaf boldly engaged my visual senses as I took the entire scene into my mind. I reached to my chopsticks to begin, when my friend said, "The taste of this meal is affected by the room we sit in"/ True.With everything around me in pure white including the plate upon the sushi was served, the thin slabs of raw fish atop the fist-sized mass of white rice appeared to float in space. I could imagine the taste to be very different in an environment that was appointed with different dishes,table, overall decorum and even different people. Ambience is the proverbial "secret sauce" to any great meal or memorable interaction. Creating white space-or, translating that to a room "clean space"-enables the foreground to stand out from the background.
