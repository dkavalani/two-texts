The annual January 26 parade celebrates the day in 1950 when a newly independent Republic of India adopted its first constitution.This year, President Barack Obama will see the festivities firsthand. He's the first U.S. leader India has invited to be the guest of honour and the first president to visit India twice in his tenure. That's a sign, I believe, of how far India has come from the nation of my childhood. Back then, I stood in the crowd thinking of things I learned in school about India's rich history and valiant struggle for freedom from British colonisers. But it was impossible to forget I was born in the "Third World." Signs of poverty and despair were everywhere.I often heard this refrain: "The East shall rise again." . But over the last two decades, I have been going home to a radically transformed India, one that has experienced immense economic growth and social change.Now, Obama is making history with his trip. He'll stand with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Rajpath, the grand avenue that leads to India Gate. All this indicates India's arrival on the global stage.
